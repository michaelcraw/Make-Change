When the program runs it will ask the user how much money is in their pocket. The user will then input any number and click enter. Then it will ask how much the candy bar costs (which can be any number the user inputs as well). Once both inputs are added, the program will tell you how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies you will have after you purchase the candy bar.
